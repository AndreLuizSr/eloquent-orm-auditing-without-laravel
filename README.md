# Eloquent ORM Auditing without Laravel (or framework)
Sometimes when you develop small applications and you use Eloquent ORM (https://github.com/illuminate/database), you need to implement auditing system.

For this, I used Illuminate Events (https://github.com/illuminate/events), developt small trait and associate this to all models.
