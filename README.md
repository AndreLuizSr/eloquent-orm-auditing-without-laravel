# Eloquent ORM Auditing without Laravel (or framework)
Sometimes I development small applications which I only use Eloquent ORM (https://github.com/illuminate/database) and, sometimes I need implement auditing.

For this, I needed use Illuminate Events (https://github.com/illuminate/events) and development small trait and associate this to all models.
